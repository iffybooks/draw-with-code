Python Turtle is a drawing tool based on Logo, a programming language developed in the 1960s to teach programming to kids. Logo was used widely in school computer labs in the '80s and '90s.

Here's how it works: The user types lines of code to control a cursor onscreen, typically represented as a turtle.

 move around 

little turtle walk around onscreen. The turtle can draw lines and curves as it goes, creating cool geometric art. Once you’ve drawn a picture, you can add a loop to your code to repeat it as many times as you want. Whether you’re new to programming or you have decades of experience, you’ll be able to have fun with Python Turtle.
