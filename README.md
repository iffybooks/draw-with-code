# Python Turtle is a drawing tool based on Logo, a programming language developed in the 1960s to teach programming to kids. Logo was used widely in school computer labs in the '80s and '90s.

Here's how it works: The user types lines of code to control a cursor onscreen, typically represented as a turtle. The turtle can draw lines and curves as it walks around, creating geometric art. The next step is to add a loop to your code, letting you repeat the instructions as many times as you want.

We'll be using Python, a programming language that comes preinstalled with many computer operating systems. Python is really cool! It's relatively easy to learn, and it's used widely by scientists, web developers, hackers, and just about everyone else.

In this workshop we'll be focusing on **turtle**, a module that comes built-in with Python.

We'll also use **IDLE**, a program that lets you write and run Python code.

At the Iffy Books computer lab we're using the Linux-based operating system **Ubuntu**. If you're getting started on your home computer, skip ahead to the section titled **<u>Using Python Turtle at Home</u>**. Once **Python 3**, **IDLE**, and **Tkinter** are installed, you can resume here.

❏ Start by opening the **terminal** application. Click the grid icon at the bottom left corner of the screen and search for "terminal," or click the terminal icon in the application bar.

❏ Type the following command into the terminal and press **enter** to launch **IDLE**. When it launches, you'll see a command prompt with three angle brackets (**>>>**) on the left side.

```
idle
```

If you're using macOS, you may need to use the command `idle3`instead.

❏ In the Idle command prompt, type the following command and press **enter**. Nothing will happen, which is normal. You've just imported a collection of tools from the `turtle` module.

```
from turtle import *
```

❏ Type the command below and press **enter**. You'll see a window pop up with a tiny turtle on a white background.

```
shape('turtle')
```

❏ Run this command to make the turtle walk forward 100 steps:

```
forward(100)
```

❏ Now use this one to make it turn left 90 degrees.

```
left(90)
```

❏ If you want to reset everything and go back to the beginning, you can use `reset()`.

```
reset()
```
